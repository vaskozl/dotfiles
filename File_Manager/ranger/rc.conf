# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create the file
# ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and add your custom commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Ask for a confirmation when running the "delete" command?
# Valid values are "always" (default), "never", "multiple"
# With "multiple", ranger will ask only if you delete multiple files at once.

# Which script is used to generate file previews?

# When false, bookmarks are saved when ranger is exited.

# You can display the "real" cumulative size of directories by using the
